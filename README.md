Introduction
The Social Network Graph Application is a simple console-based Java program that simulates a social network using a graph data structure. It allows users to create profiles, establish connections (friendships), and view relationships between users. This application demonstrates how graph structures can represent real-world networks effectively.
Features
1.	Add Users
Users can create new profiles by entering a username. Each user is represented as a node in the graph.
2.	Add Connections
Users can form friendships by connecting two profiles. Connections between users are represented as edges in the graph.
3.	View Connections
Users can check the list of friends for a particular profile, showing the direct connections for that node.
4.	Exit Program
The application can be terminated gracefully.
Purpose and Motivation
This application was created to illustrate the use of graphs in solving real-world problems in a straightforward and beginner-friendly manner.
Why this kind of application?
•	Relevance: Social networks are a ubiquitous part of modern life. Building a scaled-down simulation of a social network helps in understanding graph structures and their practical uses.
•	Simplicity: The implementation focuses on the fundamentals, making it accessible to those new to Java and data structures.
How does it contribute to me or the community?
•	For Me: This project sharpens programming skills, especially in graph theory and Java development. It also serves as a stepping stone for more complex applications, like social media analytics or pathfinding.
•	For the Community: It acts as a learning resource for students and developers seeking to understand and implement graph structures in practical scenarios.
